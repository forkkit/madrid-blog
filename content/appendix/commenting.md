Many people have told me they can't comment lately. Here is a guide to make it easier for you

## Option 1: Log in

Disqus is a common comment provider for blogs. Maybe you already have an account. You can make a new account with them or login with Google, Facebook, etc.

## Option 2: Post as a guest

You have to type in you comment, fill out your name + email, and, tick the three boxes shown and prove you're not a robot, then click the grey arrow.

I don't have control over how tricky the guest commenting process is. I recommend just logging in.

# What changed?

If you missed it, I changed comment providers. The old one was Commento, the new one is Disqus. Main motivation was to display comment counts and receive email notifications when a comment is made (so I can reply to questions).
