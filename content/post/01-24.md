# WEDNESDAY

## Leganes Tour

I'm one of three students in my program taking courses at the Leganés engineering campus of UC3M.

* it's a very new campus
* it's quite small, just a few buildings
* the classes actually have computers in them, unlike UMass

## El Prado

In the afternoon, we had a tour of the Museo del Prado, a huge art museum. We primarily talked about the works of El Greco, Goya, and Velázquez.

Pictures weren't allowed. I'm not much of an art person so I can't tell you much about the significance of what we saw. Apparently Goya's really famous but the only Goya I ever heard of was the bean brand.

Here is one of the "famous" pieces we saw, apparently a masterpiece of Velázquez

Most of the stuff was just regular old art to me. The one collection that caught my eye was some flower garland paintings by Daniel Segher. I like the geometry of them.

The museum is so big, I'm sure I only only saw a small fraction of what it contains.

# THURSDAY

Hey, that's today! I finally had free time today to get up to to date with my posts.

## UC3M Orientation

{{< img src="getafe.jpg" caption="Getafe campus" >}}

8am we were on our way to UC3M Getafe for an orientation event

* intro video had hilariously overdone stock footage
* the folks from the US Embassy are chill
* random Spanish guitar performance break, very impressive
* free t-shirt and food afterwards

Allow me to elaborate on that last point.

## A feast of churros

When they said there was churros and chocolate (*chocolate con churros*) in the cafeteria for us, I was expecting a little table that everyone would crowd around and it would just be a mess like all other college food events. I was not prepared for the scale of this golden brown spectacle.

The chocolate that you dip them in tasted like liquid chocolate pudding. It was really good and I felt gross for eating so many.

## Grocery skills

Today was a smoother day for buying groceries.

* I've been coming prepared with a bag since they charge for them here
* I finally found a store that sells proper tupperware
* I knew to weight my fruit before bringing it to the register
* I paid and left no problem

There are tons of supermarkets here, I've seen at least six of them within just a few minutes of the residence.

I also want to point out the cool shopping cart things they have here. While they do have traditional shopping carts too, I more commonly see these trolley things used. It's like the lovechild of a shopping cart and basket. It has four omnidirectional wheels on the bottom so it rolls really smoothly like a nice suitcase.

### Matt's quest for bread

I'm trying to adopt the Spanish staple of bread with olive oil. The bread I find at supermarkets has been kind of hard. I noticed some people walking out of the little *Alimentación* shops with bread under there arm. I had already checked those places out and thought they were just convenience stores with bags of chips and other packaged snacks. But sure enough, they specialize in bread too. I just had to ask for it behind the counter and I got a nice warm stick of bread, despite it being eveningtime. For 0.39€ I could definitely make a habit of this.

Tomorrow is the first day even that I *don't* have an event I have to attend with my program. I look forward to sleeping in for once.
