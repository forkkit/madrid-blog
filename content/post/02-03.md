We last left Matt with a night (and early morning) of partying.

# SUNDAY (Jan 27th)

* catchup day
* on tech support with Apple cause of a keyboard quirk
* kebab dinner
* brought home a cherimoya

### Cherimoya

I'd been eying these weird fruits in the markets since getting here.

* it's also called "custard apple"
* actually tastes a lot like the flan cups I got at the supermarket
* texture is a tad gritty like a pear
* ate it with a spoon

# MONDAY - FRIDAY

{{< img src="leganes-night.jpg" caption="the sun has just disappeared when I get out of class" >}}

## Classes

This is my initial schedule

* *Sistemas Operativos* (Operating Systems)
* *Criptografía y Seguridad* (Cryptography and Security)
* *Inteligencia Artificial* (Artificial Intelligence)
* *Informática Gráfica* (Computer Graphics)

Thoughts so far

* they are each 2 hours long and it's rough
* the cryptography class is really intense and is kind of a waste to take
* I like my AI professor a lot
* the graphics class was supposed to be my hardest, but it seems super easy

> Don't worry mom, I've since dropped the Cryptography class

## Food

* made my favorite low effort 1-pot [tomato basil pasta recipe](https://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/pasta-tomato-basil-sauce)
* had my first experience soaking and cooking dry beans
* on Friday I started the meal plan for my residencia (pictured)

{{< img src="meal-plan.jpg" caption="french fries seem to be a Spanish staple" >}}

I opted for the lowest tier, one meal only on weekdays. That's enough to take the bulk of the burden of cooking off.

## Other Highlights

* making progress on summer research applications, letters of recommendation
* delicious Indian food on the way home from campus, impressing the guy working there with some Hindi

# SATURDAY

## El Escorial

* too busy and rushed to do an extensive trip this weekend
* opted to take a day trip to El Escorial
* it's a town mostly known for its huge monastery/palace

My timing was really off in the morning, so I checked out Atocha's tropical display while I waited for my train.

### Train ride

* about an hour
* beautiful views of rural Madrid

### Arrival

This was kind of magical. The weather report told me it would be a clear day. I was not prepared for the torrents of *graupel* greeting me at the station.

> **GRAUPEL** (noun)
> <br>
> granular snow pellets

It was actually nice though, it calmed down into intermittent graupel flurries.

I saw this little village set up while I desperately searched for a public bathroom. Maybe it was supposed to be nativity scene?

I decided to just head for the palace since they probably would have bathrooms inside

### Lunch

Made my way into a cafeteria and shook a load of graupel from my hair (I'm getting as much mileage from that word as I can).

> note to self, water doesn't come with a "combo" plate

### Afternoon

I just wandered through town until the sun started to set. Almost everything was closed for siesta. Before leaving I made a stop at *la churreria* for chocolate con churros.

{{< img src="sunset.jpg" caption="the wind here is even worse than the UMass library" >}}

The warmth of the churros was the only thing keeping my fingers from freezing solid. Tasted even better this time around.

# SUNDAY

## El Rastro

My Rossman grandparents will be proud... Sunday morning is a huge flea market in the Centro district. The Spaniards won't be starting at 6am though. It runs from 9am-3pm.


{{< img src="rastro.jpg" >}}

There were a couple of things I was on the lookout for.

### Scarves

A lot of the hip guys around here wear big poofy scarves; my scarf game is weak in comparison.

### Manbags

* not as common as I expected 
* I see approx. 15% of guys donning a man bag of sorts
* the functionality would be great for my daily excursions

I didn't find any crazy deals on either of these items for now.

## Lunch

Around 2pm *everyone* on the streets had a styrofoam container with a bocadillo. This was as good a time as ever to try one.

{{< img src="bocadillo.jpg" width="70%" caption="jambon, tomato, bread, and oil">}}

### Matt reviews bocadillos

* no surprises
* you can't easily bite the jambon so you have to wrestle it with your fingers
* like when you eat pizza and all the cheese starts sliding off
* mostly just bread

**Verdict:** I am not a bocadillo believer.

## Afternoon

A friend from northern Spain knows someone in Madrid, and they made me a huge list of recommended sights to see in the city. I loaded them into Google Maps so I can easily see what's nearby. I started making my way through this list for the afternoon.

My visits included

* Puerta de Toledo
* Dalieda San Francisco
* Catedral de la Almudena
* Palacio Real de Madrid
* Rosaleda del Parque del Oeste
* Casa de Campo

{{< gallery src="park-view.jpg stairs.jpg distant-cathedral.jpg real-palace.jpg distant-cathedral-2.jpg cablecar.jpg park-sunset.jpg">}}

### Teleférico de Madrid

The end of that list was particularly spontaneous.

* spotted some distant cable cars as I walked along *Rosaleda del Parque del Oeste*
* surprisingly few people in line
* bought a one way (*ida*) ticket to wherever it would take me
* a pleasant, 10-minute ride across the sky
* dropped me in a sprawling mountainous park complex

Here there were some of the clearest views of the skyline I've seen yet. I made my way down the hills (not before stopping to swing in the playground) and soaked up the view along *Lago Casa de Campo* as the final few percent spilled from my phone battery.

I grabbed kebab *para llevar* on the way home to recharge. After 22,000 steps I deserved it.
