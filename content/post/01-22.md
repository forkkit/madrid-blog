# MONDAY

## Registration Pt. 1

9am we met at the ISA office to finalize course preferences.

I picked 4 computer science classes. It's difficult taking other classes because

* they meet at a different campus
* most are really boring (sorry, I still don't enjoy history, politics, writing...)
* they are hard to work into my schedule

## SIM Card

I stopped by the CityLife Madrid office to pick up the free starter kit I signed up for. Part of this bundle was a free SIM card from Lycamobile.

* only 10€ for 7GB data and 100 minutes
* the activation process is a pain

I ended the day going to the Mi Casa Inn office to inquire about their meal plan.

# TUESDAY

## Registration Pt 2.

8am we departed for Universidad de Carlos III (UC3M), Getafe. My classes will be at the other campus.

* like UMass, it's a race to register as soon as your slot opens
* I didn't get into 1 of my 4 classes
* ISA can make special requests to ensure we get into the classes we requested

## Afternoon

* Burger King for lunch... the group's choice not mine
* Explored *Corte Inglés* (big department store with like ten floors)
* Discovered Matadero Madrid

### Matadero

I started walking in the general direction of Legazpi hoping to find something cool. I was allured by a big clocktower, which led me to the the big entranceway of **MATADERO**. Google told me this translates to **SLAUGHTERHOUSE**. I was creeped out but intrigued.

Beyond the wall, there was a huge complex of brick buildings which opened to a huge plaza.

I checked inside of one of the buildings and seemed to be intruding on people working in glass offices.

 Nonetheless, I followed people through open doors and reached a really weird room.

It was like I entered a dark basement with its walls and ceiling unfinished. The only light came from 3 big slabs scattered around on which videos were being projected. I put on the provided headphones to listen in. One of the films was two Japanese fighter pilots expressing their feelings to each other about their shared war experience. A lot of the films were too weird to explain, but they all seemed to revolve around topics of war.

I tried to explore the other buildings and found some more odd common spaces like a warehouse style room full of artsy chairs where strangers were silently hanging out. I think that was the weirdest part of the whole complex — it was so quiet.

Most of the other buildings were closed. I returned home and made another grocery stop.

* hold up, I can get a baguette for 0.39€???
* it's hard to find chicken, but easier to find turkey meat
* I heard pork is popular, it was cheapest so I ate pork belly with rice
* ate almost the entire baguette with dinner
