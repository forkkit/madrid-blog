Night is whispering. Drum beat and fire's glow swallowed behind the dunes. Sinking strides in a careful line, stained by blinding moonlight. The expanse beckons.

If you want to set the mood here's a backing track to play:

# Morocco

{{< img src=" airport-1.jpg " >}}

The flight was

* brief (~2hr)
* more spacious than what I expected from RyanAir
* mostly spent studying Arabic script

{{< img src=" map-1.jpg " maxwidth="400px" >}}

# Fez | فاس‎ | Fès

It quickly became apparent I was in a very different country. Our drive back from the airport was decorated with pack mules, sheep herds, Mad Max-esque motorbikes, and civilians sporting winter  jackets in 70+ degree weather.

Traffic laws were not strictly enforced. Drivers seemed to be aiming for the lines rather than the space between them.

In Spain, you can't walk two blocks without finding a green glowing cross marking a pharmacy. I was quite amused to discover than this pattern has been replaced by the more Islamic glowing crescent moon in Morocco. I guess I didn't consider the medical cross holding religious connotations.

## Accomodations

We stayed in a "5 star hotel". The lobby was certainly impressive. The rooms and meals not so much. Our 3-person room wasn't fully made and the toilet was more of a smoothie maker.

## Tour

{{< gallery src=" fez-1.jpg fez-2.jpg " caption="Spot our tour guide on the left, \"Hash\", rocking that Obi-Wan look" >}}

Hash pointed out some white grave markers for Jews. As he described the area, "easy come, easy go". Not a big deal to re-use burial grounds.

### Ceramics

{{< gallery src=" ceramics-1.jpg ceramics-3.jpg ceramics-4.jpg ceramics-5.jpg " >}}

The potter was whipping up pots, vases, and tajines like nobody's business. Onlookers gasped as he swiftly ran a wire through the base and popped off each finished product.

Pretty impressive too to see them chip away at the little interlocking tiles by hand and glue them in backwards to assemble the colorful panels for fountains.

## Free time

Lunch on our own after the tour. I went with a group of people to a nearby shawarma / taco place. I just bought some fresh OJ to go with my peanut butter jelly sandwich, but everyone else's stuff looked really good too. The staff was extremely friendly and the prices were dirt cheap (10 dhm for my juice, 30 for the sandwiches).

### Drinks

This was my introduction to the vast world of Moroccan juices. It's pretty typical for places to serve fresh:

* orange juice 
* avocado juice
* banana juice

{{< gallery src=" juice-1.jpg juice-2.jpg " caption="Avocado juice, banana juice" >}}

Banana and avocado were more like a milk than a juice, but not thick like a smoothie. Slightly sweet, and very creamy. I definitely will be making banana juice when I get home.

The other famous Moroccan drink is mint tea, which is served with lots of sugar.

### On Moroccan currency

Moroccan dirhams are the currency here, not to be confused with UAE dirhams. The conversion is easy: divide by 10 to get the euro equivalent. Some places even accept euros using this method.

### On Moroccan languages

The official languages are Modern Standard Arabic (a formal, generally unspoken language akin to Latin) and Berber. However, the ones that I encountered primarily were:

* Moroccan Arabic
* French
* Spanish
* English

Some people only spoke Arabic and French, some only Arabic. Some spoke many more languages, because Moroccans are businessmen who must speak with people from all over.

I was able to re-learn enough French to get around the markets. As Arabic dialects differ so much I resorted to Google Translate for communication in the more traditional areas. Learning the script at least was helpful for allowing me to pronounce things and type them into my phone.


Curiously, in Arabic, Fez is written like "Faas". The "a" (alif) letter seems to be really flexible as I found it taking the place of an "a", "e", or "i" sound in different words.

### Bakeries

The French pastries looked really good... except for the thick coating of flies and bees. I'd like to see the look on an American food inspector walking into one of these places. I decided to pass on buying anything.

## Streets of Fez 

Simply walking around was entertaining. I have never felt like such a foreigner. I fully embraced my tourist status and donned a very functional ball cap. People would stare, and fascinated youngsters would happily greet us with a "bonjour".

### Cats

They are everywhere in Morocco. I saw as many cats roaming the streets here as I do squirrels in the states.

{{< gallery src=" cats-1.jpg cats-2.jpg cats-3.jpg cats-4.jpg " >}}

### People

The Moroccan people are so friendly. The staff at the shawarma shop was particularly kind and accommodating to us. I later went back there to ask for tips on exchanging a shirt I bought. The woman working there was asking for my shirt size, prepared to give me one of her sons'.

When I explore, I gravitate towards tall things. I ran into some little kids while climbing up a nearby hill. They flagged me down to come over, and though they only spoke Arabic we went on a little hiking adventure together. Surprisingly, they lacked much interest in the caramels I offered them. We parted ways before the summit.

### Call to prayer

Throughout the day, all of the mosques erupt in a synchronized loudspeaker prayer call. At this point worshippers head to the nearest mosque. These buildings were beautiful and plentiful. They served as convenient landmarks for navigation.

I had the pleasure of witnessing this at dusk at the top of the hill.

# Medina (old city)

This place is a market maze. We were taught two important phrases.

* Shukran = thank you
* Balak = move your ass to the wall or get plowed by a donkey

### What I came in knowing

* you can barter things down to almost a tenth of the asking price
* shopkeepers are relentlessly pushy
* the general value of items, from watching people on YouTube barter

### What other students did
* bought items at asking price
* got scammed out of hundreds of dollars on what turned out to be fake items
* wished that they brought more money (instead of wishing they spent less)

### What our program managers should have done
* not taken us on a walking infomercial tour
* informed students about how to be shrewd buyers
* allowed us to shop independently
* informed us of how much items are actually worth

Last picture is from the leather tannery, which smells so bad that they hand you a sprig of mint to hold under your nose at the entrance. Part of the reason for the smell is they harvest pigeon poop to bleach the leather.


## Food

**Water**: you can't drink it from the tap. I bought a 5L jug of mineral water and a smaller handheld bottle for a couple bucks which lasted me most of the trip.

Moroccan food is primarily vaguely yellow stewed vegetables. They also have tasty round bread (10 cents, even cheaper than Spain), oranges, and bananas.

## Culture

We went to a cultural show that included:

* belly dancing (awkward)
* corny magic tricks
* a weird play
* drumming and tassel spinning
