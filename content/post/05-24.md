> This is not my last post, I'm just super backed up. Two more posts in the works. I'm writing this on the plane back to the USA.

# Projects

* I skipped a bunch of classes to make the France trip work
* came back to many big projects to complete
* locked myself in my room for a few days to catch up on everything

## Graphics

We had to create a "realistic" render using Blender. I took a picture of a corner of my desk and tried to recreate the scene.

I was happy with the result and I got a lot of compliments when I presented it in class.

## Artificial intelligence

We had to implement a search problem that could help a pizza delivery guy pick the shortest route to pick up and deliver pizzas.

## Operating systems

We had to implement components of a stock market taking into account multiple brokers trying to access the market at the same time. *Yawn*.


# Finals

* went fairly smoothly despite my last minute studying
* each was ~2hrs long
* most exams consisted of a few multiple choice and a couple long answers
* didn't have to take my graphics final since my grade was already high

# Friends

* some highschool friends came to visit Madrid on Fri (May 17th)
* gave them suggestions on things to see
* had some meals together (kebab, Spanish food, montaditos)
* picked up one more friend (Herrick) at the airport on Sun
* we spent the day together while the other friends visited Toledo

They headed off to Rome for a few days while I finished another final.

# Perizoso

That's the Spanish word for sloth, also used to mean lazy, also used to describe me during the middle-end of May. For a few days it was hard to get motivated to go out an do things. My time abroad was running out and I had no more trips planned. I fell into a boring daily routine.

But things soon took a turn for the better. Stay tuned.
