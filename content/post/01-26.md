# FRIDAY

This was another day of exploration.

## Invernadero del Palacio de Cristal de Arganzuela

There was a greenouse near Matadero that I wanted to check out, so I started there.

## Plaza Rio

I spotted a wacky looking building across the river and found it to be a shopping mall.

### Notes on rebajas season

* t-shirts for 3€
* shoes for 20€
* pants for 10€

I tried on some stuff for kicks. The tighter pants here are really comfy and I will definitely get some.

The thing that caught my eye about this building in the first place was the crazy design around the roof, with big tubes and glass chambers. It turns out those are actually for little kids to climb around in, like a McDonald's playplace.

There was also a really nice strip of restaurants with a great view of the city.

* kebab restaurants are super common around here
* a kebab (the sandwich) goes for 2.50€
* way better price and quality than typical fast food

## Parque Lineal del Manzanares

On the train ride to UC3M I made a note of a weird statue of a head on a hill that I wanted to visit later. It turned out to be in the same direction as the mall so I kept walking until I got there.

I waited for sunset at the top.

I just barely had enough juice in my phone to snap pictures and find my way back home.

# SATURDAY

## Toledo

First ISA excursion

* 1 hour bus ride, most people slept
* stopped at a scenic outlook then continued to the city
* visited Monasterio de San Juan de los Reyes
* visited a mosque
* saw El Greco's masterpiece *The Burial of the Count of Orgaz*
* visited the huge cathedral
* free time for food

Here's a bunch of touristy photos

### Food

For lunch I finally got a taste of authentic Spanish cuisine. I went with some other students to get a three course meal for just 10€.

The natillas was especially amazing. It looks like regular custard, but as soon as it hits your tongue it goes down like whipped cream.

I also tried some of Toledo's famous *mazapan* which just tasted like an almond cookie from the grab bag.

## Erasumus party

* I was pretty exhausted after the trip
* met some international people in *la cocina*
* they invited me to an "erasmus" (EU term for study abroad) party
* 10€ for entry + 2 drinks

Most of the other people in my program have been dropping lots of money on parties every night. This was the first time I opted to go out.

* went with 2 French people, an Italian, and 2 Americans
* the line was really long
* it was unexpectedly pirate themed
* I got trapped in the bathroom (until someone kicked the door in)
* stayed until 3:30AM
* metro didn't run that late so I walked an hour home

Okay. Now I was *really* exhausted. Overall a good time.
