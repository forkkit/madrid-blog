Las Fallas in Valencia is a multi-week festival that was  highly praised during
pre-departure travel panels so I made it a point to visit.

# What is a "falla"?

It took me a long time to answer this simple question. My first impression was
that it was the name of the statues that are the main attraction, but it's a
broader term that can refer to:

* the statues
* the communities that built them
* the celebrations

# The Fallas statues

* made of paper mache
* some of the subjects are satirical or provide social commentary
* each large statue was accompanied by a smaller children's display
* they get burnt down at the end of the festival as seen here:

I didn't get to stay for that part because it happens late Tuesday night and I had an exam on Monday.

# Explosives

It's a huge part of the culture of the festival.

## Mascleta

Every day at 2pm the city center erupts in a daytime fireworks display.

 The first day I got lucky and was right near the center. The second day I slept
 in. The third, it was so packed I just barely got a view of the center.

I was glad I came prepared with earplugs. The five minutes of heavy duty
explosives shakes your chest... and the earth.

# Food

Of course, the most important part. Being a huge festival, there were tons of street vendors with a variety of food options.

## Churros... churros everywhere

You can't walk two blocks without finding a *churreria*. And these ones are **good**. Aside from your typical *churros* and *porra*, they features *rellenos*, a glorius stuffed sugary monstrosity filled with all sorts of unhealthy stuff (the best being Nutella).

The Kinder-culture here means Nutella in everything, which I am a fan of.

## Paella

Valencia is the home of the famous Spanish dish *paella* (it means "pan", which is how it's served). I met up with another ISA member on the first night to have proper Valencia paella, and then found some much cheaper on the last day at a street vendor.

## More sweets

They've also got markets with huge displays of candy, such as these massive gummy ropes.

There's a gelato shop here that claims to have the best gelato in all of Spain (they won some official awards) so I tried two of their winning flavors. One was a Nutella type flavor (of course) and the other was I think called "Sicilian orange surprise" which had a very nice tart flavor.

# Accomodations

I stayed in the cheapest Airbnb I could find, $10 a night. The catch was that transportation was a major headache. The staff at the transit agency were very rude and impatient with me, and falsely told me that I couldn't use their service to reach the property. I ended up wasting money on a bus pass that I couldn't even fully take advantage of, because all of the streets within the city were closed for the festival.

* stayed at the apartment of the owner's friend (Sergio)
* Sergio spoke very little English
* he was on his way out to a cooking class (resulting in a tasty treat in the morning)

# Nightlights

On Saturday I met up with a Spanish friend I had been chatting with online using my language exchange app. Her friend told me that this year the lights weren't nearly as impressive as last year but I thought they were still very impressive.
