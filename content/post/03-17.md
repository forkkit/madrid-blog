Las Fallas in Valencia is a multi-week festival that was  highly praised during
pre-departure travel panels so I made it a point to visit.

# Q: What is a "falla"?

It took me a long time to answer this simple question. My first impression was
that it was the name of the statues that are the main attraction, but it's a
broader term that can refer to:

* the statues
* the communities that built them
* the celebrations

# The Fallas statues

* made of paper mache
* some of the subjects are satirical or provide social commentary
* each large statue was accompanied by a smaller children's display
* they get burnt down at the end of the festival

# Explosives

It's a huge part of the culture of the festival.

## Mascleta

Every day at 2pm the city center erupts in a daytime fireworks display.

 The first day I got lucky and was right near the center. The second day I slept
 in. The third, it was so packed I just barely got a view of the center.

I was glad I came prepared with earplugs. The five minutes of heavy duty
explosives shakes your chest and the earth.
