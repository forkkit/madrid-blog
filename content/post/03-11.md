During another one of my late night travel planning sessions I settled on Cuenca per Aunt Sharon's suggestion. Boy was that a good decision. This weekend turned out to be my favorite so far.

## On cultural differences

Aunt Sharon wanted to know what cultural differences I see in Spain vs America. Here is an incomplete list of the first things that come to mind.

### Smoking

I take for granted how well the US has curbed smoking. I don't know anyone in the states who smokes cigarettes. In Spain it is very common among people young and old. I see the same behavior among the French and Italian students at my residencia, where they'll excuse themselves to go smoke outside.

### Shops

In the US we do most of our shopping at large chain stores. In Spain I see a lot more small, local stores (like fruterias, alimentaciones). Many of them, I'm not sure how they stay in business. This gets annoying because they tend to be more affected by siesta hours so you're out of luck shopping from 2-5pm.

### Restaurants

Pros:

* tax is included in the price = nice even bills
* no tipping
* menu del dia - reasonably priced 3 course meal

Cons:

* unpredictable portion sizes - see my water story later on
* limited coverage of the food pyramid - where my veggies at?
* feeling thirsty - no free water, no refills

I miss the American dining experience.

### Overall

More focus on living, enjoying life than making money. Then again as our program managers explained, the cost of living in Madrid is higher than most people there can afford so not sure how well that's working out for them...

# Palacio Real

* Tuesday was an ISA trip to Madrid's Royal Palace
* aparently the royalty used to hotbox the oriental living rooms with opiates
* weirdly realistic painting of the modern royal family

# Cuenca

Yeah, it's out of order but here's a little overview of the city I made towards the end of my visit:

I nearly booked a flight to Vienna but I was so busy with schoolwork, it was too overwhelming to plan on such short notice.

I've kept Cuenca in my back pocket since my Aunt Sharon mentioned it on here early on. It is known for its cliffside "hanging houses" but the main attraction for me was a dirt cheap hostel with rave reviews. It seemed like a relaxing city to check out but I wasn't expecting much.

## Friday

* pleasant bus ride (around 2hrs) at 10am
* arrived in a more urban environment than I expected

### Green River Hostel

I checked into the *Green River Hostel* located along the titular green river. Despite the English name, the lady working there only spoke Spanish. This is the nicest hostel I've stayed in. They have a theme of ducks.

The only weird thing is the bathrooms—it's a bunch of stalls located in the hallway, so have fun pooping in front of your neighbors.

The hostel location is just at the base of the old city. I asked the receptionist where to find cheap food. She recommended a plaza at the other end of the old town. Since the city is built on cliffs it's a climb to get up there.

Passing through Plaza Mayor, things started off with some excitement as one of the main restaurants had a fire. Seemed like everyone got out okay eventually.

Lunch was in a beautiful area overlooking the rocky basin. I thought it was hilarious that my menu del dia came with a liter and a half of water (enough for a six people).

### Distant landmarks

{{< gallery src="sat-statue-dist.jpg sat-eyes-close.jpg" >}}

Two items caught my eye early on:

* a distant hill (mountain?) with a big statue on top
* a pair of green eyes peering from the opposing hill

I wanted to see these up close. I started with the statue.

I passed some rock climbers on the way up. It felt so nice to be in nature for once. I appreciate how easy it is to find quiet places in Cuenca.

Coming down was scary. I keep forgetting that watching sunset on a mountain means hiking down in the dark. I don't know what kinds of animals roam the Cuenca woods but the gravestones along the trail weren't comforting. I could have sworn I heard distant howling.

### Cuenca by night

This city glows at night. Not just the streets — they project lights onto the nearby mountains (I couldn't really get this on camera). It reminds me of the night style from *Spirited Away*

{{< gallery src="sat-night-1.jpg sat-night-2.jpg sat-night-3.jpg" >}}

There were a number of live music shows going on in bars around town. I took to the side streets to find a free one.

The music was alright, not my style. I felt really out of place.

I'm embarrased that I didn't know the word *cincuenta* (fifty) when the barista told me the price of my drink.
I think the fact that most of my change was in fifty cent coins was her way of passive-aggresively hinting at me to learn it.
