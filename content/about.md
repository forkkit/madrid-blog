# The purpose of this blog

I have two motivations for making this:

* family members that want to know what I'm up to
* a record of my own memory of the experience

# The structure of this blog

I don't want this blog to be a novel. I intend to structure things as a combinations of brief narratives stringing together collections of observations and pictures. I will try to keep things moving.

* bullet points are going to be our friend

# How to use this blog

I've tried to keep it simple. I tag posts by location (like major cities or other countries). In the overflow menu on the top right, you can click one of the tagged locations to see all the posts about it.

# The nerdy stuff

This blog is produced with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) based on the [Aether](https://themes.gohugo.io/aether/) theme. The blog source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mattrossman/madrid-blog). It's built and hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

~~Comments are powered by [Commento.io](https://commento.io/)~~ I migrated to [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) because Commento doesn't give me much control of the comment data, and Disqus lets me fetch article commment counts, receive email updates on commend threads, and more.

[Zapier](https://zapier.com/) detects new entries to the [RSS feed]({{< url "post/index.xml" >}}) and formats the email body. [TinyLetter](https://tinyletter.com/) manages subscribers and delivers the formatted emails.

[Nanogallery2](https://nanogallery2.nanostudio.org/) formats the photo galleries. [Pannellum](https://pannellum.org/) formats the 360 degree view photos.
