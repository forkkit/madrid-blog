# The purpose of this blog

I have two motivations for making this:

* family members that want to know what I'm up to
* a record of my own memory of the experience

# The structure of this blog

I don't want this blog to be a novel. I intend to structure things as a combinations of brief narratives stringing together collections of observations and pictures. I will try to keep things moving.

* bullet points are going to be our friend

# How to use this blog

I've tried to keep it simple. I'm planning on tagging posts by location (like major cities or other countries). In the overflow menu on the top right, you can click one of the tagged locations to see all the posts about that location. For now, it's just Madrid.

# Planned features

* newsletter for updates, new posts
* comments on posts

# The nerdy stuff
